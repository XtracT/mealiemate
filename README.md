# MealieMate

MealieMate is a collection of Python scripts bundled in a service that integrate with [Mealie](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie), [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), and [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) to provide advanced meal planning, recipe tagging, and shopping list generationâ€”powered by OpenAI GPT. Each script can be controlled via switches in Home Assistant, and logs its progress and feedback in several sensors.

*Disclaimer*: This is a project to help me learn different things, I am just sharing it openly to learn even more.

## Features

1. **Recipe Tagger**  
   Uses GPT to classify your Mealie recipes with appropriate tags and categories automatically. The AI analyzes recipe ingredients and names to assign relevant tags from predefined categories.

2. **Meal Planner**  
   Generates structured, balanced meal plans based on Mealie recipes (tags and categories), user constraints, and existing plans. Follows specific rules like scheduling pizza on Fridays and ensuring nutritional balance.

3. **Shopping List Generator**  
   Consolidates ingredients from your upcoming meal plan into a single structured shopping list in Mealie. The AI intelligently combines similar items, standardizes quantities, and organizes by category for easier shopping.

4. **Mealplan Fetcher**  
   Gets the mealplan for the next 7 days and makes it available in Home Assistant, including direct links to every recipe. Also generates a visually appealing image that can be sent via Telegram using a bot.

5. **Neapolitan Pizza Calculator**  
   Calculates precise dough ingredients and fermentation schedules for Neapolitan-style pizza based on temperature and time parameters. Uses a scientific approach to adjust yeast quantities for consistent results.

## Technical Improvements

The codebase has been enhanced with several improvements:

- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular plugin system that allows for easy extension and maintenance. Each feature is implemented as a plugin with a clear interface.
- **Dependency Injection**: Service interfaces and a dependency injection container for better testability and loose coupling between components.
- **Type Hints**: Comprehensive type annotations throughout the codebase for better IDE support and static type checking.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with specific error messages and appropriate fallbacks.
- **Logging**: Structured logging system for easier debugging and monitoring.
- **Code Organization**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns:
  - `core/`: Core interfaces and infrastructure
  - `plugins/`: Feature implementations as plugins
  - `services/`: Service implementations
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- **Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings with detailed parameter descriptions and return value information.
- **Performance**: Optimized code for better performance and resource usage.

## Integrations

### Mealie

The tools perform API requests to Mealie using HTTP. A token from your Mealie instance is required to authenticate. The integration handles recipe fetching, meal plan management, and shopping list creation.

### OpenAI GPT

The tools send relevant data and instructions to the `gpt-4o` model for processing. The integration includes retry logic, error handling, and optimized prompts for consistent results. An API token from OpenAI is needed to enable GPT functionality.

### Home Assistant

These scripts automatically register a new device named **"MealieMate"** in Home Assistant using **MQTT discovery**. They provide switches and sensors for configuring, triggering, and reading the output of each script. The integration includes:

- Switches to enable/disable each script
- Sensors to display script output and status
- Number inputs for configuration parameters
- Text inputs for user messages and preferences

### Telegram

The Mealplan Fetcher can send generated meal plan images directly to a Telegram chat, providing an easy way to view your weekly meal plan on mobile devices.
